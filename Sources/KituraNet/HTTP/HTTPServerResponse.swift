/**
This class implements the `ServerResponse` protocol for outgoing server
responses via the HTTP protocol. Data and Strings can be written.

The example below uses this in its `response` parameter, with the example requesting a connection be upgraded and catch any errors that occur.
### Usage Example: ###
````swift
 func upgradeConnection(handler: IncomingSocketHandler, request: ServerRequest, response: ServerResponse) {
     guard let protocols = request.headers["Upgrade"] else {
         do {
             response.statusCode = HTTPStatusCode.badRequest

             Log.error("Failed to send error response to Upgrade request")
